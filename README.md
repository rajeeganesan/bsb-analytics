goal: identify whether or not plate discipline can be 
utilized as a predictive model to identify a player's clutch, BA, WPA & wins.

disc rating is an overall measure of plate discipling that uses a form of a z-score to calculate an overall rating of how disciplined a hitter is based on their score in comparison to the MLB average. in this case, a negative disc rating indicates a more disciplined hitter.
disc ratings were calculated among all MLB teams that had eligible players.

potential correlations were then explored between disc rating and 1. clutch, 2. BA, 3. WPA, in order
to attempt to find a potential predictive model. player's disc ratings were then combined to study any potential relationship between disc rating and actual wins from the 2018 season.
